# Hotel_CRM
A prototype single unit hotel CRM system
Trial Sales Database12.accdb file is the final prototype CRM application
THis project was completed over 1.5 years starting with my employement as the Director of Sales at a La Quinta Inn and suites where I created the hotels sales system initally using paper forms. Then I led a team to create the SQL database that digitized my sales proccess for my advance databse class in both MySQL and Access. Finally I led a small team to build a front end for the database using Access due to cost considerations for the hotel.

## 1.0 Executive Summary 
Apoco Designs is working with La Quinta Inn and Suites, Stillwater, OK on a project to develop a functional prototype for a hotel sales CRM system. The reason for this project is the current CRM system is a combination of paper and electronic documents along with a poorly implemented freeware Zoho CRM system. The Zoho system lacks any hotel specific functionality and is only somewhat helpful for some sales pipelines. The lack of a formal sales system and sales information system has hindered the La Quinta’s ability to attract large corporate clientele and also make it difficult to provide excellent customer service to clients that book through sales. Apoco Designs was commissioned to build a functional prototype to show management of the La Quinta Stillwater that a custom hotel specific CRM system will improve the sales process, increase group and corporate customer satisfaction and decrease errors caused by the current sales process.

Apoco Designs has analyzed the problems with the current CRM system and provided La Quinta Inn with a custom hotel sales pipeline specific CRM system. We have developed the new CRM application to act as both a contact manager and deal manager for the sales process. This new CRM system will help make hotel’s sales more efficient by eliminating issues such as data redundancy, long email threads, switching between multiple applications to track the information about a prospective contact or a corporate deal and misplacing paperwork. We have used MS Access as our tool to develop the user interface and database for the new functional prototype hotel sales CRM system

Initially, the scope for the project was broader and included having a plan to make the proposed prototype CRM application integrated with La Quinta’ corporate CRM system which is Salesforce, Central Reservation System (CRS) and Global Distribution System (GDS). But, with the recent buyout of La Quinta Hotels by the Wyndham Hotels group, we decided to limit the scope of our application to the individual unit only .i.e. La Quinta Inn and Suites, Stillwater, OK.
